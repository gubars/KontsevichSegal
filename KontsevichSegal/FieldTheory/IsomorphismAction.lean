/- The isomorphism-action axiom on a field theory (KS paper Section 3,
arXiv:2105.10161; KSTeX line 408): a germ isomorphism acts on the field
theory's spaces, smoothly in the isomorphism.

THE PAPER'S CLAUSE. "Whichever line we take, we must assume that an isomorphism
f : Σ₀ → Σ₁ of germs of d-manifolds induces an isomorphism f_* : E_{Σ₀} → E_{Σ₁}
which depends smoothly on f, in the sense that for any family P × Σ₀ → Σ₁
parametrized by a finite-dimensional manifold P the induced map
P × E_{Σ₀} → E_{Σ₁} is smooth."

This is a condition ON THE FUNCTOR (a `FieldTheory`), never on the cobordism
category (Category vs. functor boundary, CLAUDE.md), encoded without the `axiom`
keyword and without exhibiting any concrete instance. Two assumed layers feed it:

* ASSUMED Layer-1 geometry (`GermIsoGeometry`): the groupoid of germ
  isomorphisms. Isomorphisms of metric germs (preserving the complex metric and
  the co-orientation, bundled into the assumed object data exactly as in
  `CobordismGeometry.Obj`) are smooth-germ geometry absent from Mathlib — the
  `found:smooth-cobordism-geometry` gap, and precisely the missing structure the
  time-symmetry stand-in records (`Unitarity.lean`: the `o = dualConj o`
  equality caveat waits for an object/germ-isomorphism notion; the witness is
  "a germ diffeomorphism, not a cobordism"). Unlike the cobordisms, germ
  isomorphisms DO have identities and inverses, so the honest interface is a
  groupoid: `Iso`, `idIso`, `compIso`, `invIso` with the five groupoid laws.
  NOT Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.Groupoid`: that extends `Category` →
  `CategoryStruct` → `Quiver`, and `Cobordism.instSemicategory` already installs
  the `Quiver` on `g.Obj` with `⟶` the cobordisms; a second `Quiver` instance on
  the same type would collide. The assumed smooth-family notion
  (`IsSmoothIsoFamily`: which `P`-families of isomorphisms are the paper's
  smooth families `P × Σ₀ → Σ₁`) also lives here: it is germ geometry.

* ASSUMED infrastructure (`SmoothLinearFamilies`): smoothness for a `P`-family
  of continuous linear maps into the Fréchet fibres. Mathlib's manifold calculus
  (`ModelWithCorners`, `MDifferentiable`, `ContMDiff`) requires NORMED model
  spaces, so no genuine smoothness notion exists for Fréchet targets (the same
  Fréchet-manifold gap as `MetCManifold`/`HolomorphicBundle`), and the abstract
  parameter manifold (`TangentStructure`) carries no calculus at all. The notion
  is therefore assumed as a predicate, PINNED, not floating: constant families
  are smooth (`isSmoothMapFamily_const`) and smooth families are JOINTLY
  CONTINUOUS (`isSmoothMapFamily_continuous`). The pin excludes the
  everything-is-smooth satisfier (`fun _ => True` would assert every family
  jointly continuous, which is false), so the assumed predicate cannot collapse
  below joint continuity.

* THE AXIOM (`IsoAction`): the action `f ↦ f_*`, landing in genuine continuous
  linear equivalences `T.E a ≃L[ℂ] T.E b` ("induces an ISOMORPHISM"), pinned
  float-free by functoriality — `act_id` and `act_comp` make `act` a groupoid
  representation, not a free family of equivalences — and depending smoothly on
  `f` (`act_smooth`, stated against the two assumed smoothness notions). NO
  `f_*`-vs-`Z` compatibility field is added: the paper asserts none in this
  clause (No-approximations cuts both ways).

NON-VACUITY. `GermIsoGeometry` cannot be emptied (`idIso` forces every
`Iso o o` inhabited). `IsoAction` bites three ways: (i) `act_comp` pins `act` —
an idempotent `f` (`compIso f f = f`) forces `act f = refl`, and
`(f⁻¹)_* = (f_*)⁻¹` is FORCED (`IsoAction.act_inv`, proved below); (ii)
whenever the assumed geometry makes `Iso a b` nonempty, `act` forces
`T.E a ≃L T.E b`, so a theory whose fibres are not isomorphic across isomorphic
germs cannot carry an `IsoAction`; (iii) along smooth families the action must
be jointly continuous, via the pin. Over the degenerate discrete geometry
(`Iso a b := PLift (a = b)`) a transport satisfier exists; that is the standard
scope-(a) state of every Layer-1 parametric class here (`MonoidalCobordism`,
`DualConjugateGeometry`), never instantiated by design.

DEFERRED (documented, not faked): any genuine smooth structure on the
germ-isomorphism spaces, and genuine calculus on maps into Fréchet fibres —
both rest on the smooth-germ geometry and Fréchet-manifold gaps recorded at
`found:smooth-cobordism-geometry` and `def:metc-complex-manifold`.

Germ isomorphisms are NOT cobordisms (`Mor`): unlike the cobordisms they have
identities and inverses, forming a genuine groupoid. Mathlib's
`CategoryTheory.Groupoid` is not used because it extends `Category` →
`CategoryStruct` → `Quiver`, and `Cobordism.instSemicategory` already installs
the `Quiver` on `g.Obj` with `⟶` the cobordisms. This `class` records the

no genuine notion exists for the Fréchet fibres of a field theory; the notion is
assumed as a predicate, PINNED by two laws: constant families are smooth, and
smooth families are jointly continuous. The pin excludes the trivial
`fun _ => True` satisfier (it would assert every family jointly continuous,
which is false), so the assumed notion cannot collapse below joint continuity.

/-- **The isomorphism-action axiom on a field theory (KS Section 3, KSTeX line
408; blueprint `def:isomorphism-action`).** A germ isomorphism `f : Σ₀ → Σ₁`
induces an isomorphism `f_* : E_{Σ₀} ≃L E_{Σ₁}`, functorially and smoothly:

* `act` — the action `f ↦ f_*`, a genuine continuous linear equivalence
  ("induces an ISOMORPHISM");
* `act_id`, `act_comp` — functoriality, the float-free pin: `act` is a groupoid
  representation, not a free family of equivalences (these force
  `(f⁻¹)_* = (f_*)⁻¹`, proved as `IsoAction.act_inv`);
* `act_smooth` — the smooth dependence on `f`: a smooth family of isomorphisms
  induces a smooth family `P × E_{Σ₀} → E_{Σ₁}`, stated against the assumed
  smoothness notions (whose continuity pin makes it bite).
